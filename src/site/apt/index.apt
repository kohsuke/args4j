  args4j is a small Java class library that makes it easy to parse command line options/arguments in your CUI application.

Why should I use it?

  See {{{https://web.archive.org/web/20120605024439/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2005/05/parsing_command.html}my quick intro}}.

 * It makes command line parsing very easy by using annotations

 * Generate usage text very easily

 * Generate HTML/XML documentation listing all options

 * Full localization support

 * Designed to parse <<<javac>>> like options, as opposed to GNU-style (where <<<ls -lR>>> is considered to have two options <<<l>>> and <<<R>>>).

 * Licensed under {{{http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php}the MIT license}}.
